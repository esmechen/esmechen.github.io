        <h1> Auracle App </h1>
        <h2> iOS App Development </h2>
        <h4> Swift XCode <h4>
        <p> I worked on the Auracle application as part of my first-year research in the Auracle Lab, during
            which I was mentored by Professor Kotz and Sougata Sen. My research project was titled, "A mobile
            application for aggregating, storing, and presenting Auracle-generated eating behavior data."
            It focused on (1) prompting the Auracle’s user and collecting Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA)
            responses from the user and (2) receiving, processing, displaying, and storing data from the
            Auracle wearable device. </p>

        <h3>About the Auracle Project</h3>
        <p> The overall Auracle project is two-fold: <br><br>
            (1) The <i> Auracle device </i> is an earpiece that detects the wearer’s real-time
            eating patterns, such as the time, length, and frequency of eating episodes, in
            free-living conditions. <br>
            (2) The <i> Auracle mobile application</i>, a crucial component of the research
            process, is an iOS mobile application that connects the Auracle device to the user’s personal
            smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The app receives, processes, displays, and
            stores real-time data from the Auracle device. The Auracle application was originally developed
            by the DALI Lab. <br>
        </p>

        <h3> My Contributions </h3>
        <p> I contributed to the iOS application by adding two new features, which were (1) prompting
            the Auracle’s user and collecting Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses from the
            user and (2) receiving, processing, displaying, and storing data from the Auracle wearable device. </p>
        <h4> 1. EMAs to Gather Information About Eating Episodes </h4>
        <p> Several lab studies using the Auracle device require periodic user response. I added functionality to allow the app to periodically prompt the user for an EMA response. When a user selects “Fill Out Now” in the alert, the screen transitions to a horizontal paging UIScrollView that enables the user to easily scroll between questions accessed from a remote database. Users can respond to each question using a slider. The slider has a configurable lower and upper response bound (e.g., “not at all” to “extremely”) which maps to a response from 0 to 100 in the backend. After answering the last question, the user taps “Done,” and the question ID, time stamp, question, and response value are stored locally in the phone. At the end of the study, the researcher can export the aggregated user responses in the form of a CSV. </p>

        <h5> The application before connection with Auracle (left), searching for Bluetooth devices to connect to (middle), and after connection with Auracle (right). </h5>
        <p> In this part of the project, I worked on connecting the Auracle app to the Auracle
            wearable device via a Bluetooth connection, as well as processing, displaying, and storing the data received.
            To initialize the communication between an Auracle device and a
            phone, the phone should be paired with the Auracle device. When the
            app is launched, a “Connect Auracle" button appears. Upon tapping
            the button, the app scans for and displays nearby Auracle devices in a
            list view. The user chooses an Auracle device to connect to, and the
            “Status” screen changes to indicate a successful connection.
            The app now receives data from the Auracle device. The data are
            displayed in a daily timeline and stored in the phone’s local
            database according to the message structure in the figure shown below. Finally, the
            researcher is able to access all transmitted data by exporting the
            aggregated data in a spreadsheet (CSV) file. </p>

        <h5> The messages transmitted from the Auracle BLE are in hexadecimal and follow the structure shown above. </h5>
