        <h1> DALI Lab x Worthee Collaboration </h1>
        <h2> Natural Language Processing </h2>
        <h4> Ruby / Python / Watson Tone Analyzer & Knowledge Studio <h4>
        <p> Our team of designers, developers, and project manager at the DALI Lab
            worked in close partnership with executives from Worthee to incorporate emotion sentiment
            analysis into the Worthee mobile application to rate reliability of member reviews.
            As a developer on this project, I worked on creating a custom-trained model for reliable reviews by
            annotating a dataset of real reviews given to us by our Worthee partner using Watson Knowledge Studio.
            I also helped with incorporating the Watson Tone Analyzer API into the application. </p>

        <h3>About</h3>
        <p> Worthee is an app with the goal of helping low wage workers attain their dream jobs.
            To accomplish this, Worthee allows employees to review other coworkers.
            As the app stands right now (in fall 2019), every review must be approved or denied by
            a member of the Worthee team which takes up time and energy. Our development goal for the
            term at the DALI Lab was to create an AI system that would filter out  unhelpful or negative
            reviews and assign each member a personal “credibility score” based on their history of
            negative reviews written. By making the review system more efficient, we hoped to help
            Worthee in their quest of empowering low wage workers. </p>

        <h3>Development Progress</h3>
        <p> The main development goal this term was to integrate artificial intelligence functionality
            into the Worthee application that would analyze Worthee user reviews based on varying degrees
            of emotion. The returned data on user reviews was then used to assign reviews scores on a
            continuum from “good” to “bad.” This would automate the process of approving or disapproving
            user reviews, which is currently (as of fall 2019) being manually done from Worthee’s administration dashboard. </p>

        <h3>App Access and Tools Used</h3>
        <p> Worthee reviews were scored using the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer API service, which analyzed words
            and sentences for varying degrees of emotions, which included the following: anger, fear, joy, sadness,
            analytical, confident, tentative. In the testing stage, the Tone Analyzer API was called using Insomnia
            and a Python script that pulled Worthee reviews from a spreadsheet, funneled them to the IBM Tone Analyzer
            API, and returned emotion sentiment data. The client module code to call the Tone Analyzer API was written
            in Ruby, and the Ruby component of the online IDE Repl.ie was used to test scoring and parsing capabilities
            of the module before integrating it to Worthee’s codebase. IBM Watson Knowledge Studio was used to
            annotate Worthee reviews to create a custom-trained model. </p>

        <h3> Core Functionality: Review Filtering </h3>
        <h4> Using Watson Tone Analyzer API </h4>
        <p> After getting the necessary credentials and figuring out the optimal endpoint to which to make our API calls,
            I made some manual calls to the API using our own pre-generated text using the REST client Insomnia to see
            what tones Watson would discover in each. For example, to learn more about how Watson evaluates a comment
            as the somewhat nebulous quality of “Tentative,” I made some calls on sentences that may be encountered in
            Worthee, such as “I’m not sure who this coworker is” and observed Watson’s JSON response. Seeing examples
            of Watson analyzing custom sentences allowed us, the two developers working on the project, a clearer picture of how Watson’s sentiment analysis values
            align with what we consider “high quality” comments, and allowed us to familiarize ourselves with the
            working components of the API client. </p>
        <h4> Training Model </h4>
        <p> The next step after getting individual API calls to run was to write a script to analyze a dataset of
            real reviews from the Worthee app, given to us from Worthee executives. I annotated
            these Worthee reviews in IBM’s Knowledge Studio and contributed to writing a Python script to extract the first 1000 comments
            from Worthee’s already-existing comment database, run Watson’s sentiment analysis on each, and construct
            a Pandas dataframe to hold the returned sentiment values. The dataframe was structured to hold the text
            comment, a value ranging from [0...1) for each of the seven tones Watson analyzes, a column of that
            comment’s length, and a 0 or 1 to represent whether the Worthee team had manually approved or
            disapproved that comment in the past.  My co-developer and I planned on using this dataframe to manually train a custom
            Watson Tone Analyzer model so that it could be tuned more precisely to the qualities of a satisfactory
            Worthee comment. We did not end up using this dataframe due to time and work constraints, but the creation
            of the dataframe was useful for cross-referencing Watson sentiment analysis values with whether or not
            a comment had been deemed satisfactory by the Worthee Team. It became much clearer what a truly high
            quality comment looked like in Worthee, and the sentiment values that often accompany these good comments. </p>
